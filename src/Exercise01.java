/*
Exercise1
Variables & data types Coding Exercise
Inside the already defined main method of the Exercise class, your task is to:

Declare and initialize the following variables:

An int variable named age with the value 25

A double variable named height with the value 5.9

A String variable named name with the value "Alex"

Use System.out.println() to print the values in the exact following format:

Name: Alex,  Age: 25,  Height: 5.9

Instructions

Do not create a new class or main method â€” both are already provided.

Focus only on declaring variables and printing them.

Use System.out.println() for output, and ensure the format matches the expected output exactly.



Expected Output:

  Name: Alex,  Age: 25,  Height: 5.9

public class Exercise01 {
    public static void main(String[] args){

        // write code here
        int age = 25;
        double height = 5.9;
        String name ="Alex";
        System.out.println("Name: " + name +", Age: " + age +", Height: " + height);

    }
}
